> Ever since I set up this blog, I had this urge to write. Write about anything I can think of. But I always wanted the beginning to be the most memorable one. I wanted to write that one special post, that sticks. I kept on thinking – what can be written that is as good as saying “Hello, World!” but says more than that. As it turns out nothing is.

I first started this draft on the night of 31st December at 11:44 p.m., minutes before The New Year. At that time things were different. All I could think was how 2015’s going to be. And more importantly, will 2015 be the year I have been waiting for, for the last 3 years? I tend to get very sentimental at that time of year. The short days and cold nights are a perfect trigger for introspection, and I enjoy taking the time to be conscious and grateful for all the good things that have happened over the past year.

So what good things happened to me over the past year? I, at last, truly realized my love for programming, for making things, for solving problems, for making others happy. Another great thing was getting into ACM ICPC Amritapuri Regional. Couldn’t go to the regional contest because of end semester examination, but well, I knew I couldn’t have performed well there. Though I am happy, that I coded my way to the regional – few people got to do that.

I am not a very good writer – as you can see the published date of this post. From 31st December to this day, as I already mentioned, many things have changed. I deleted this post at least 10 times because apparently it wasn’t good enough. These past few days have been an emotional roller-coaster for me. Not going to go into the depth but I realized a few important things about life. And more importantly, I began to appreciate small things, small gestures – which I may have taken as granted in the past. I have realized that nothing is good enough, like the original post. There always will be something missing and you got to accept that. I had forgotten about this blog until very recently someone said, “Hey, why don’t you write it, doofus!” Those are the kinds of words you don’t get to hear every day. But let’s not get carried away.

So about 2015. This is a very special year. This is the year where – fingers crossed – I get my dreams to life. The Google Dream. The ACM ICPC World Final Dream. You must be thinking, man those are ambitious dreams. Yes they are. Perhaps that’s the beautiful part of the dreams. You see them every day, long enough till they turn into reality. You just got to believe in it. Be persistent and never give up. And, don’t fall asleep yet. Contrary to the popular belief, that’s not where dreams get accomplished.
