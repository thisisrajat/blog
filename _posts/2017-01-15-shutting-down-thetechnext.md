> It’s time to sleep. So long, and thanks for all the fish! - TheTechNext

TheTechNext, short for The Technology Next was my blog, my technology blog. I was eighteen-year-old when I started writing this blog. At the time I thought this is it. This is my calling. Writing technology articles was the best thing that could’ve ever happened to me. I adored every part of it. My main motivation for starting a blog was albeit a tad selfish but I loved writing my own opinions.

As soon as my college began, it all got over. And, I never tried to keep it afloat.

3 years into the college, I knew two things. First, that I was better at programming than writing. Second, I did not have the luxury of time to keep writing blog posts.

This simple realization sparked a clever idea. The idea was to turn the TheTechNext blog into something different. A different kind of blog. A blog, that would auto aggregate things. To put a cherry on top, content would be auto-summarized. Awesome, right?

The only obstacle between the old blog to the new automated content aggregator was code.

I started with the planning phase. Planned for a week. Sketched out a good algorithm by drawing inspiration from what was already out there. Made some more custom rules to make it, even more, better. Then, soon enough I started coding.

And, there is was. Transformed from the stale old blog to the evergreen automated intelligent blog. I was so proud of what I had accomplished.

This also got over soon. I don’t know where did this go wrong.

I did not even use the app I created.

I have a couple of hypothesis about what exactly went wrong. First, I was now less interested in the new versions of iPhone and more interested in other things. I had a much different perspective about technology since I started coding. Second, that the service had no options to filter or choose the type of content. It was all or nothing. You could have it all or read none of it. Third, it had some quirks. Quirks that are more subtle that you’d imagine. Sometimes the summarized text would spit out a gigantic paragraph. God knows who could read it.

While creating this app, I thought it might serve the grand purpose. The single purpose of having a place where all the news would be accessible and readable.

But things change. So do people. TheTechNext’s mission was no longer relevant. And, I often at times pondered about what can be a future of this service/app.

That’s the precise reason I am pulling the plug on TheTechNext. If you loved the service then Thank You. I appreciate your gratefulness.

It’s time for this service to sleep. But, like all good stories, this also will have a good ending.

It’s not over. It’s far from over. Actually, it’s starting now.

One of the things that I started out to solve with TheTechNext was the information consumption. I still believe that we’re in the age where there is too much to consume. There is too much information to read through properly. Journalism nowadays is more of copying and pasting and back-linking.

Let’s solve this problem. Presenting, **Frackxn** (pronounced as Fraction). It’s gonna be awesome. Stay tuned.
